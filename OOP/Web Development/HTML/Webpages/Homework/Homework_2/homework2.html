<h2>About the Waltons</h2>
<hr>
<p>
In 1962, Sam Walton embarked on a journey to achieve global
success in retail, making a difference in the lives of people
and customers. Thanks to his visionary leadership, and the generations
of associates helping customers, Walmart has globalized a way to help
people <strong>"save money and live better."</strong> Shortly
after his death in 1992, his prized fortune of <strong>$8.6 billion</strong>
was inherited by his four children; Alice, Jim, John, and Samuel Walton. Today,
that revenue is at a astonishing <strong>$524 billion</strong>, not to mention
their combined estimated wealth of <strong>$130 billion</strong>, deeming them
the richest family in America, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/families/list">
<em>Forbes</em></a>. It seems that the Walton's did not only inherit their father's wealth,
but also his drive for greatness. He once said that,
<blockquote cite="https://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/history/10-rules-for-building-a-business">
<strong>
<mark>
"If everybody is doing it one way, there's a good chance you can
find your niche by going exactly in the opposite direction."
</mark>
</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sam couldn't be more then proud to see the change his business
has brought for many communities.

<h3><em>The Best Value is Great Value</em></h3>
<p>
By 1993, Walmart launched it's Great Value brand.
It ended up spanning over

more than 100 categories and is the country's largest
food brand in both sales and volume.
</q>
</mark>
</strong>
<p>
The <abbr title="Great Value">GV</abbr> brand has been
recorded to earn more than $27 billion annually. Walmart's
<abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr>, Doug McMillan, stated that
<blockquote cite="https://storebrands.com/walmarts-great-value-brand-earns-more-27-billion-
annually#:~:text=%2218%20of%20them%20do%20more,%2427%20billion%20a%20year%20globally.%22">
<strong>
<mark>
"We prefer's to sell brands for less, but we're also improving
our private brands, and they're growing faster than our overall
sales. 18 of them do more than $1 billion in sales and our largest
private brand Great Value does more than $27 billion a year globally."

<p>
Groceries and private label penetration, is pivotal to grossing
Walmart's business.

annually#:~:text=%2218%20of%20them%20do%20more,%2427%20billion%20a%20year%20globally.%22">
Grocery sales on a two-year stacked basis were among the best
in the 10 years.
</q>
<p>
The <abbr title="Great Value">GV</abbr> brand is set in place
to provide convenience for customers. Sam always thought about
the benefit of customers, and what better way to go by doing
so, then to create a brand with lower prices then what you
would see in your average marketplace. Great Value makes
shopping with ease less than a risk.

<h3><em>Leading the Future of Retail</em></h3>
<p>
In 1990, Walmart became the No.1 retailer, and today it still is.
This time around the technology has become more universal in our economy,
and Walmart sees the advantage. Walmart unrevealed its new technological weapon,
called the "<strong>Alphabot</strong>." The <a
href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/01/08/how-walmarts-alphabot-is-helping-to-
revolutionize-online-grocery-pickup-and-
delivery#:~:text=Developed%20specially%20for%20Walmart%20by,items%20ordered%20for%20online%20grocery
.">
Alphabot</a> is used to assist Walmart in picking, packing and delivering online grocery
orders faster. The new platform has been in testing since 2019. With Walmart's grocery
revenue making up for 56% of their sales, this new technology can be a big help to managing
and handling online customers. This is efficient for a supermarket like Walmart do to their
online hustle of customers. With other potential rivals, such as Amazon, Costco and Kroger,
Walmart has been been holding its own. However, leading is not only about taking action,
it's also about giving. In 1987, The <abbr title="Walton Family Foundation">WFF</abbr>
was established. <dfn>The Walton Family Foundation</dfn> is a family-led foundation that
tackles tough social and environmental problems with urgency and a long-term approach
to create access to opportunity for people and communities.
