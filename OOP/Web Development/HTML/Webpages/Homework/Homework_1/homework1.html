<h2>Brief History of Walmart</h2>
<hr>
<h3><em>Sam Walton's Journey to Success</em></h3>
<p>
At just age 26, with <strong>$5,000</strong> saved up, and a loan gifted from his father-in-law,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Walton">Sam Walton</a> purchased a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_(company)">Ben Franklin</a> variety store, where
he average <strong>$225,000</strong> in three years. With his powerful mindset for indulging in retail
and franchise concepts, he achieved great success in a small period of time, before he became the big
retail mogul he is today. Walmart's mission statement is to "save people money so they can live better."
With our economy already making it difficult to survive, it was Sam Walton that believed,
<blockquote cite="https://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/our-history">
<strong>
"if we work together, we'll lower the cost of living for everyone, we'll
give the world an opportunity to see what it's like to save and have a better life."
</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
Walmart is the worlds largest retailer by far, the company reels in a towering
<strong>$524 billion</strong> dollars a year in total revenue.
<q cite="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/walmart-is-a-grocery-powerhouse-and-it-still-has-room-to-
run.html">
Grocery sales make up for <strong>56%</strong> of Walmart's total U.S. revenue,
making it the country's largest grocer.

</p>
<p>
The legacy of Sam Walton still lives on today, as he has set the tone for many businesses in
the food industry and retail. To achieve this prolonged and epic success, he used the strategy
in believing that,
<blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/sam_walton_46810">
<strong>
"There is only one boss. The customer. And he can fire everybody in the company from chairman on
down, simply by spending his money somewhere else."
</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>
This saying sets the tone for, "the customer is always right." It's clear that Amazon might be the
clear winner in delivery, but Walmart will always be the leader in grocery pickup.
