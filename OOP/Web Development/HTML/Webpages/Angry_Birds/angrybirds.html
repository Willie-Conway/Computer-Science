  Uses The image element to
  to embed the image of a angry
  bird Graphics Interchange Format(GIF)
  and uses even-handler attributes
  onmouseover and onmouseout to create
  a large image effect whenever the pointer
  moves over the image and a regular
  image effect whenever the pointer moves out
  of the image. The image is specified with a
  absolute path with a link to the source and 
  a height and width of 32 X 32 pixels, and alt
  providing alternative information
  for the image.
-->
    <img onmouseover="LargeImg(this)" onmouseout="regularImg(this)" src="https://i.gifer.com/Yw8u.gif"
     alt="AngryBird" width="32" height="32">
    <p>
       The function LargeImg() is triggered when the user mouse over the image. <br>
       This function enlarges the image. This is a onmouseover effect, <br>
       the onmouseover attribute is firing whenever the mouse pointer
       moves over the element.
    </p>
    <p>
       The function regularImg() is triggered when the mouse pointer is moved out of the
       image. <br> That function sets the height and width of the image back to normal.
       This is a onmouseout effect, <br>
       the onmouseout attribute is firing whenever the mouse pointer moves
       out of an element.
