Java Keywords
--------------




 Keywords in Java are something that
 has got a special meaning. It is a
 predefined word which has special meaning
 in Java and these words cannot be used
 as object reference, variables, or data member.

-------------------------------------------------

 Example: If we want to store a numeric data,
 we use a keyword called “int” If we want to store 
 a character value, we use char keyword. If we want
 to store a decimal value, we use either float or
 double keyword.

 Total numbers of keywords in java
 We have a total of 53 keywords in java.
 In which, 3 are literals or constant value
 such as true, false, and null. And on the
 remaining 50, we don’t use 2 keywords in
 java ( goto and const).

(true, false, null.)
